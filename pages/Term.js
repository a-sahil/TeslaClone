      By clicking "Schedule Demo Drive", I authorize Tesla to contact me about my requested 
      demo drive or lease demo drive, as well as with more information about Tesla products, 
      services and regional events via the contact information I provide. I understand calls
       or texts may use automatic or computer-assisted dialing or pre-recorded messages. 
       Normal message and data rates apply. I can opt out at any time in the Tesla app or by 
       unsubscribing. This is not required for purchase. Drivers must have a valid U.S. 
       driver's license and be 18 years of age or older.
